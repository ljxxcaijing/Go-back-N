# Go-back-N

Implement the Go-back-N automatic repeat request (ARQ) scheme and carry out a number of experiments to evaluate its performance. In the process I expect that you will develop a good understanding of
ARQ schemes and reliable data transfer protocols and build a number of fundamental skills related to writing transport layer services, including:
+ encapsulating application data into transport layer segments by including transport headers,
+ buffering and managing data received from, or to be delivered to, the application,
+ managing the window size at the sender,
+ computing checksums, and
+ using the UDP socket interface.
